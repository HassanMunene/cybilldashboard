Gibberish text for Hackathon
Hub within a hackathon where the users will come to test the products.
The qr code to make them affiliate marketers. They will get their revenue share. board with a qr code to register and send them identification code to test the products. the affiliate guys. Link they can invite their customers to their page/shop and the link should have their details like their id so that when the customers buys the bitdefender product and we give them the commission. The customer does not need to login anywhere with this link. they just go straight to the page. 
In the hackathon we can decide how many we recruit. So  we will have the walkin Experience upto registration. We build the walkin experience.

Now How do I pass this message to users when looking at the modals for them to really understand what they are required because they need to understand that there will be a couple of zones, for b2b testing and b2c testing. The could choose the testing they want to do. If they want to do b2b then they will get product key for b2b if they choose b2c they could will get the product key for b2c.

The dashboard can serve several purposes depending on the goals of your hackathon and user engagement strategy. Here are some potential features and functionalities for the dashboard:

User Overview: Display a summary of the user's information, including their name, email, and chosen testing type.

Product Key Management: Provide a section where users can view and manage their product keys. This could include the ability to regenerate or retrieve lost keys.

Testing Resources: Offer resources related to the testing they are participating in (B2B or B2C), such as guides, FAQs, and best practices.

Feedback Submission: Implement a form where users can submit their feedback on the products they are testing. This can help gather insights for further development.

Progress Tracking: If applicable, show the user's progress in the testing program, including completed tasks, upcoming deadlines, or milestones.

Community Engagement: Create a space for community discussions, forums, or chat features where participants can connect, share experiences, and ask questions.

Updates and Announcements: Provide a section for important announcements, updates on the hackathon, or upcoming events related to the testing programs.

Profile Settings: Allow users to update their personal information, change their password, or manage their account settings.

Support: Offer contact information or links to support resources for any issues users might encounter during their testing journey.

Resource Downloads: Provide downloadable materials, such as software, documentation, or other resources relevant to their testing experience.

By providing these features, the dashboard can enhance user engagement and make their testing experience more organized and informative.

I wanna write an email to my manager about an hackathon event that we are supposed to organize. My colleague and I were support to create a walkin experience, that will help and register the users to our application. But we have some questions that we need to clarify, because once the user registers are we supposed to send them a licence key and if so How will we avail the licence key to them . are they stored in a database somewhere or? something else what will be the competitive edge of this hackathon because i dont still understand how will the participants compete in this hackathon. My manager said they will be competing by testing bitdefender products. If so then how will the testing be done on their phones or laptops and How will we measure the competitiveness how do we know someone  has performed better than the other so that we can award them
